== Neo4j is a Graph Database

+++
<table style="margin: 0 auto; margin-top: -50px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Graph</th>
    <th>Chart</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

    </td>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

+++ <!-- This is the neo4j web console.  We will see a demo later --> +++

== Why Neo4j?

* Expressive and natural data modeling
* Easy and powerful query language (http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[cypher])
* Fast and easy querying on complex data relationships
* ACID / Replication

== Neo4j Crash Course

* Nodes and Relationships
* Both are key->value stores
* Nodes can have zero or more labels (User, Post, etc...)
* Relationships have a type (i.e. wrote_post)

== Neo4j Crash Course

* Relationships go from one node to another (directional)
* Querying can be directional or direction agnostic

== Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User)<-[rel:written_by]-(post:Post)
  WHERE user.id = 123
  RETURN rel.location, post
----

* Return post and location it was made
* Location stored on the relationship

+++ <!-- ASCII art --> +++

== Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)<-[:written_by]-(:Post)<-[:comments_on]-(c:Comment)-[:written_by]->(u2:User)
  WHERE u.id = 123
  RETURN u2.name, count(c)
----

* Returns users who commented on posts by user #123
* Gives count of the number of comments for each users

+++ <!-- Automatic aggregation on columns when using an aggregate function.  Could also do RETURN p, u2, count(c) to get posts and a count of users for those posts.  Pause for questions --> +++

== Use cases - social graph
